# Introduction

Welcome to the Next Kickstart documentation!

## What is Next-Kickstart?

Next Kickstart is a web development CLI toolkit designed for straightforward
configuration and enhanced type-safety. It streamlines the process of setting up
new full-stack projects by providing all the necessary tools, all without the
need for manual configuration.

## Core Pieces

Next Kickstart includes several core components that are automatically set up
when you initialize a new project. These components are
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/)
(JavaScript is not supported), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
[T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/docs/introduction), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and
[Prettier](https://prettier.io). This selection represents an opinionated
development stack.

Additionally, there are other core components available in this development
stack, which are not added by default during initialization. However, you can
include them either during the project setup or at any later point using the
"add" command. These components consist of [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)
(with [Supabase](https://supabase.com) DB support),
[NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org), [ShadCN/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), and
[tRPC](https://trpc.io).

This setup provides flexibility and allows you to tailor your project to your
specific needs.
